#This is my qa profile for application.properties

#To activate this profile I just have to write below line in our main application.properties file
#spring.profiles.active=qa, we will just write the profile name only.

#Spring will first read the qa profile and override the values that are present in application.properties with
#qa profile, then it will add the remaining properties from the application.properties file
