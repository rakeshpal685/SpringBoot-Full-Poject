=================Annotations for testing======================

1. @SpringBootTest - This will load all the beans from the context which will be heavy when we are just testing
for a specific layer only

2. @DataJpaTest - use this to test for repo layer, Ideally we should use this method to test our repository,
because once the test is completed, it will flush the data and the database won't be impacted.

3.@ComponentScan(basePackage="com,xyz.abc") - Use this to get the beans from the package specified in your
testing class. We can use this with other annotations too.

4.@ComponentScan(basePackageClasses="com,xyz.abc"), to get the bean of that particular class.

5. When we are saving something in the @Test method, everything happens inside a transactional space,
everything will be rolled back when the method ends. To persist the changes permanently in testing we can use
@Rollback(false) or use @commit, which uses @Rollback internally.
